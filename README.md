## About Metamusic
Metamusic is an app that allows the player to create a unique vr instrument based on a procedural string that utilizes voice to control synths instead of using complex knobs and dials.

Simply imply what you want with some keywords while the mic is activated, and it's done without any
hands on effort.

This shows the ability to have **0 menus** and still have versatility with just basic interaction,
and the power of your voice.

## How to build from project

simply go to 'file>build and run' while your quest 2 is plugged in.

## How to play
1)Use the quest controllers to point at a point to where you want your synth spline to begin, then pull the right index trigger.

2)Point to the next location and pull on the right index trigger again to set the second position.

3)You can delete these splines by putting your hand in them and hitting the 'B' button on your quest controller.

4)Use the right hand trigger(the grippy one) to grab a spline and play notes.

5)While holding the spline, use the 'Y' button on your left controller to activate voice. There's examples of commands in the
purple dialog on the left.

6)Play around with values and set each of your synths to different values. Have fun.
